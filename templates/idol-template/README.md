## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Brief.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Customer.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Hero.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Pricing.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
